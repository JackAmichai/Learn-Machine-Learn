## 2026-01-27 - TensorFlow.js dataSync in Render Loop
**Learning:** `tf.Tensor.dataSync()` is a blocking operation that halts the JS thread until the GPU is done. Using it inside a React component's render body (even inside an IIFE) without memoization causes severe performance degradation on every re-render, even if the data hasn't changed.
**Action:** Always wrap `dataSync()` calls or any tensor extraction logic in `useMemo` dependent on the model version or weights revision.
