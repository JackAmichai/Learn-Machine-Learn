## 2024-05-22 - TensorFlow.js dataSync() Bottleneck
**Learning:** `dataSync()` in TensorFlow.js blocks the main thread. Using it inside React components (especially during high-frequency updates like training loops) causes severe UI jank. Even small tensors can cause delays waiting for GPU-CPU synchronization.
**Action:** Always prefer `await tensor.data()` for extracting values for visualization. Wrap extraction logic in `useEffect` and manage the data in React state to decouple rendering from weight fetching.

## 2024-10-24 - Synchronous TensorFlow.js Operations in Render Loop
**Learning:** TensorFlow.js `dataSync()` is a blocking synchronous operation that transfers data from GPU to CPU. Calling this inside a React component's render body (via an IIFE) causes significant performance degradation as it blocks the main thread on every render.
**Action:** Always wrap `dataSync()` or any heavy TF.js extraction logic in `useMemo` or `useEffect` to ensure it only runs when necessary (e.g., when model version changes).

## 2026-01-27 - TensorFlow.js dataSync in Render Loop
**Learning:** `tf.Tensor.dataSync()` is a blocking operation that halts the JS thread until the GPU is done. Using it inside a React component's render body (even inside an IIFE) without memoization causes severe performance degradation on every re-render, even if the data hasn't changed.
**Action:** Always wrap `dataSync()` calls or any tensor extraction logic in `useMemo` dependent on the model version or weights revision.

## 2024-05-22 - Synchronous TF.js Operations in Render
**Learning:** TensorFlow.js `dataSync()` is a synchronous blocking operation. Using it directly inside a React component's render body (e.g., in `NetworkGraph`) causes significant performance degradation on every re-render.
**Action:** Always wrap weight extraction logic or any TF.js `dataSync()` calls in `useMemo` to ensure they only run when the model or structure actually changes.
## 2024-05-24 - Asynchronous Rendering in tfjs with tidy
**Learning:** When converting synchronous `dataSync()` to asynchronous `.data()` inside a React `useEffect`, you cannot use `tf.tidy()` to wrap the async resolution. Doing so causes memory leaks if the async block throws or if tensors aren't managed correctly, and the tidy block doesn't capture the asynchronously created tensors properly.
**Action:** Instead, wrap the synchronous tensor creation and prediction in `tf.tidy()` and return the final prediction tensor. `await` its `.data()` outside the tidy block, and manually `dispose()` the final tensor in a `try/finally` block. Also, always include a cancellation token (`isStale`) in the cleanup function to prevent state updates/rendering when the component is unmounted or effect is re-run.
