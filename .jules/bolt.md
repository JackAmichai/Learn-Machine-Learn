## 2024-05-22 - TensorFlow.js dataSync() Bottleneck
**Learning:** `dataSync()` in TensorFlow.js blocks the main thread. Using it inside React components (especially during high-frequency updates like training loops) causes severe UI jank. Even small tensors can cause delays waiting for GPU-CPU synchronization.
**Action:** Always prefer `await tensor.data()` for extracting values for visualization. Wrap extraction logic in `useEffect` and manage the data in React state to decouple rendering from weight fetching.

## 2024-10-24 - Synchronous TensorFlow.js Operations in Render Loop
**Learning:** TensorFlow.js `dataSync()` is a blocking synchronous operation that transfers data from GPU to CPU. Calling this inside a React component's render body (via an IIFE) causes significant performance degradation as it blocks the main thread on every render.
**Action:** Always wrap `dataSync()` or any heavy TF.js extraction logic in `useMemo` or `useEffect` to ensure it only runs when necessary (e.g., when model version changes).

## 2026-01-27 - TensorFlow.js dataSync in Render Loop
**Learning:** `tf.Tensor.dataSync()` is a blocking operation that halts the JS thread until the GPU is done. Using it inside a React component's render body (even inside an IIFE) without memoization causes severe performance degradation on every re-render, even if the data hasn't changed.
**Action:** Always wrap `dataSync()` calls or any tensor extraction logic in `useMemo` dependent on the model version or weights revision.

## 2024-05-22 - Synchronous TF.js Operations in Render
**Learning:** TensorFlow.js `dataSync()` is a synchronous blocking operation. Using it directly inside a React component's render body (e.g., in `NetworkGraph`) causes significant performance degradation on every re-render.
**Action:** Always wrap weight extraction logic or any TF.js `dataSync()` calls in `useMemo` to ensure they only run when the model or structure actually changes.
## 2024-10-25 - React useEffect Async Operations and Canvas Clearing
**Learning:** When migrating from synchronous TensorFlow.js data extraction (`dataSync()`) to asynchronous extraction (`await tensor.data()`) within a React `useEffect` for canvas rendering, the `ctx.clearRect()` operation must be placed *after* the `await` call. If the canvas is cleared synchronously before awaiting the data, the browser may paint the cleared state to the screen, causing a visual flicker every time the data updates. Furthermore, it's essential to check an `isActive` flag immediately after the `await` to prevent the component from attempting to render on an unmounted canvas.
**Action:** Always structure async canvas rendering loops such that state extraction and awaiting happen first, followed by the cancellation check, followed by the canvas clear, and finally the drawing operations.
