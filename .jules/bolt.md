## 2024-05-22 - Synchronous TF.js Operations in Render
**Learning:** TensorFlow.js `dataSync()` is a synchronous blocking operation. Using it directly inside a React component's render body (e.g., in `NetworkGraph`) causes significant performance degradation on every re-render.
**Action:** Always wrap weight extraction logic or any TF.js `dataSync()` calls in `useMemo` to ensure they only run when the model or structure actually changes.
