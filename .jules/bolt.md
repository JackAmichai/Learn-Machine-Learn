## 2025-05-15 - Layout Thrashing in Canvas Drawing
**Learning:** The `VisionCanvas` component was performing `getComputedStyle` and `getBoundingClientRect` on every `mousemove` event, causing severe layout thrashing. This is a common anti-pattern in drawing applications.
**Action:** When implementing interactive canvas components, always cache layout dimensions and styles (e.g., in refs or state updated via ResizeObserver/MutationObserver) rather than reading them synchronously in the event loop. Use `nativeEvent.offsetX/Y` instead of `clientX - rect.left` where possible to avoid `getBoundingClientRect` entirely.
