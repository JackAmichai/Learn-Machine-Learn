## 2024-10-24 - Synchronous TensorFlow.js Operations in Render Loop
**Learning:** TensorFlow.js `dataSync()` is a blocking synchronous operation that transfers data from GPU to CPU. Calling this inside a React component's render body (via an IIFE) causes significant performance degradation as it blocks the main thread on every render.
**Action:** Always wrap `dataSync()` or any heavy TF.js extraction logic in `useMemo` or `useEffect` to ensure it only runs when necessary (e.g., when model version changes).
