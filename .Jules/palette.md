## 2025-02-18 - Nested Interactive Controls
**Learning:** Placing interactive Tooltips (which use `tabIndex` and `role="button"`) inside Buttons creates invalid HTML (nested interactive controls). This disrupts the tab order and confuses screen readers, making the interface unpredictable for assistive technology users.
**Action:** Refactor UI patterns to ensure buttons contain only non-interactive content (text/icons). Place complex educational tooltips adjacent to the action button or rely on the button's own text/label to convey meaning, moving detailed definitions to a contextually appropriate location nearby.
